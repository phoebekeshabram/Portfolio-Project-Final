    <h1> About Me</h1>
      <p> Hi, my name is Phoebe, and thank you for viewing my portfolio! I was born and raised in Monterey, California, but currently reside in Vancouver, Washington, with my husband and two children. While working on my BFA, I got married and had two children which ultimately required me to put my career aside for a few years. That is until I learned about Thinkful. My interest in development came about a year ago, after learning about it from my husband, who is an IT Specialist for the Oregon National Guard. <p>My work in graphic design felt like it was hitting a lot of dead ends, so after some deliberation I decided to enroll in the Thinkful Software Engineering Immersion Program.<p>I've always had an interest in tech, as early as 10 years old working on my MySpace page layout and design. I have been equally passionate about problem solving and puzzles, so with having a solid skillset in design, I feel confident in the programmer I am becoming. As the tech industry continues to explore unknown possibilities and advances in human life, I am excited to be catching this fast pace ride into the world of software engineering. Working on a team of great, hard-working programmers is something I look forward to and value. I know my unique perspective combing the arts, humanities, and technology will be the foundation for many innovative and creative projects to be born.
